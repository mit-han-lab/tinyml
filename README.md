# Tiny Machine Learning [[website]](https://tinyml.mit.edu)

**[News]** We refactored MCUNet into a standalone repo: https://github.com/mit-han-lab/mcunet. Please follow the new repo for updates on TinyEngine release!

**[News]** We actively collaborate with industrial partners for real-world TinyML applications. Our technolgy has successfully influenced many products and deployed on over 100K IoT devices. Feel free to contact Prof. Song Han for more info.

## About TinyML
Intelligent edge devices with rich sensors (e.g., billions of mobile phones and IoT devices) have been ubiquitous 
in our daily lives. Combining artificial intelligence (AI) and these edge devices, 
there are vast real-world applications such as smart home, smart retail, autonomous driving, 
and so on. However, the state-of-the-art deep learning AI systems typically require tremendous 
resources (e.g., large labeled dataset, many computational resources, many AI experts), 
both for training and inference. This hinders the application of these powerful deep learning 
AI systems on edge devices. The [TinyML project](https://tinyml.mit.edu) aims to improve the efficiency of deep learning 
AI systems by requiring less computation, fewer engineers, and less data, 
to facilitate the giant market of edge AI and AIoT.
